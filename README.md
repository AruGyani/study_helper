## What inspired us.
Using [Blackboard Learn](https://www.blackboard.com/teaching-learning/learning-management/blackboard-learn), we all found one common issue. Blackboard offers a feature which displays the due date of any given assignment. While this alone is quite a useful feature to have, each class we take has its own set of assignments, quizzes, and exams we need to keep track of. **So**, we thought why not develop a tool to generate efficient study schedules for us based on all our assignments? Implementing *common-sense reasoning* into this tool allows for quick, smart  generation of schedules that aid timely completion of assignments.

## What you learned.
Using the *s(CASP)* system was relatively new to us. Through this experience, we learned more about how to employ *s(CASP)* and take advantage of the tools it provides us. 

Working in Prolog was a new experience for some of us. We learned better ways to implement syntax and how to employ Prolog in a useful manner.
